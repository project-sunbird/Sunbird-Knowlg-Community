# Sunbird Knowlg

Sunbird Knowlg has powerful asset and knowledge management capabilities that can be used to create, curate, approve, publish and manage large numbers of assets, e.g. millions of documents, several hundred hours of videos, thousands of interactive content, quizzes etc.&#x20;

Content created using Sunbird Knowlg are tagged using a multi-dimension tagging framework called Taxonomy.  This enriches the content's metadata and aids in content discovery.

Contents are served to users using content Search and Discovery Service.  Content Search and Discovery take user's preferences and content usage attributes like ratings etc into account while serving the content to the user. &#x20;
