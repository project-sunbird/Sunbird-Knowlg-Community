# Taxonomy
Sunbird Taxonomy is a powerful engine that allows multiple taxonomies and frameworks (for building curriculums, competency maps, etc.) to be defined within the platform so that assets can be organized and accessed accordingly.

Taxonomy module enables flexibility to support multiple pedagogic frameworks, different ways of classification and organization of learning assests along with tools to allow the community to manage the taxonomy.

## Background
An open infrastructure for organizing knowledge across various learning content and frameworks to solve easy discoverability of relevant content.
Expert created taxonomies are highly sophisticated, as communities and content scale, it is very difficult for a community user to understand the taxonomy and it takes significant discipline to tag content. Taxonomy and tagging infrastructure is a generic service which allows a highly automated way to create and enrich taxonomies and allow tagging, aggregation and categorization of content.


### Feature
* Semantic Search and Discovery
* Multilingual Search and Discovery 
* Ability to create vocabularies
* Curation and tagging tools
* Auto-tagging using Machine Learning
* Telemetry data for policy making


## Use Cases
There are more than ten million teachers in India, many syllabi, many textbooks, varied pedagogic styles, methods, teaching techniques, and wide diversity of student demographics and contexts. Taxonomy and tagging infrastructure makes it possible to  easily categorize knowledge and makes it discoverable.
