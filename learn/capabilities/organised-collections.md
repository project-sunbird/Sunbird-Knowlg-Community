Collections are a multi-level hierarchical set of assets -content, question sets or even other collections.

The key capabilities of Collections are:

* Ability to create various categories of collections as per your solution or specific to your domain needs.

* Ability to link one or more assets (of any type defined in the asset model) under a given folder. The type of assets that can be linked at a given level is configuration driven.

* Ability to tag metadata at all levels to ensure efficient organization of collections and to facilitate ease of discovery:

&#x20;      a) The collection (root) level&#x20;

&#x20;      b) Folder level and&#x20;

&#x20;      c) As part of asset to collection relation

Note: the list of metadata attributes at all these levels is configuration driven.

* Ability for 'Deep copy' & 'Shallow copy' of collections.

_A “deep” copy of a collection copies the complete hierarchy and the asset links, the assets themselves are not copied_**.**

_A “shallow” copy of a collection just copies the root and points to the same hierarchy of original collection._
