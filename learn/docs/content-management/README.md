# Asset Management

Asset management modules enable to manage and define different assets and their properties using various tools and frameworks in Sunbird.&#x20;

### Asset

The asset in Knowledge management is the building block that is clustered together to form relevant information to the users. For example: In an office scenario, assets are the equipment like tables, chairs, stationery etc. Similarly, in the Sunbird context, the assets are named as content, collections, events etc.&#x20;

* [Players](content-player/): The player is used for consuming the asset by the end-user.
* [Service](content-service/): The asset service is a set of APIs to manage asset objects (learning assets) and their lifecycle (creation, modification, reviewing, publishing, retrieval)
