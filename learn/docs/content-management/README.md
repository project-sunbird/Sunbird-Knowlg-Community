# Knowledge Management

Knowledge management modules enable knowledge management capabilities in sunbird using various tools and frameworks. The asset management module is consistent with content APIs, editors and players.

The content service is a set of APIs to manage asset objects (learning assets) and their lifecycle (creation, modification, reviewing, publishing, retrieval). The editor provides the tools to create and manage assets using UI on top of APIs. The player is used for consuming the asset by the end-user.

The knowledge management module consists of the following components:&#x20;

* [Editors](content-editors/)&#x20;
* [Players](player/)
* [Service](content-service/)
* [APIs](../../../docs/content/API/content-api.md)
