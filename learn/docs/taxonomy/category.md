# Category

### Category&#x20;

This represents the actual items that are defined and created based on different use cases. Unlike an Object, which is a core entity of the system, a category is just a “label” tagged to an object and can defined a specific set of properties and behaviours - which are a subset of those supported by the object. Hence, categories are completely driven by configuration, without any category specific logic implemented in the code. Example from education - Exam Question paper, Practice Worksheet, Quiz each one is a category of the object type Question set Analogous example from the real-world - A Shoe, Sandal, Flip-flops each one is a category of the object type foot wear Following pages provide details of the various types of objects that are part of sunbird and a default set of categories configured.
